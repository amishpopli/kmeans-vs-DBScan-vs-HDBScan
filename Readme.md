## kmeans-vs-DBScan-vs-HDBScan

We compare the performance of the 3 commonly used clustering algorithms (actually 2 - kmeans is more sort of a partitioning method than a clustering one). 

Finally we build a final hybrid cluster based on HDBscan adn Kneighbours approach (Kneighbours is used to assign the points to a cluster that were classified as noise by HDBScan)
